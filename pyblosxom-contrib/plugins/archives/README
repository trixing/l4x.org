This README is for pyarchives_enhanced.py, which is an enhanced version of the
old pyarchives plugin.

Added functionality:
    - yearly archives
    - number of an archive's entries can be displayed
    - toggling functionality (open/close) for monthly archives is available
      through javascript and CSS


HOW TO ENABLE THE TOGGLING FUNCTIONALITY:

1) Make sure the content of pyarchives.js or the file itself is included in
   your head flavor template's head section, for example:
     <script type="text/javascript" src="/js/pyarchives.js"></script>

2) Copy opened.png and closed.png to your images directory.

3) Update your CSS file. For an example, see example.css. Make sure that the
   url-path in the closed and open classes' background-property refers to the
   files you have copied in step 2.


For further information about how to configure the plugin's output, please
read the documentation in the top section of the file pyblosxom_enhanced.py.

  <title>Instant Camera Upload Apps on iOS and Android
</title>

<p>Apple 'Photostream', Dropbox 'Camera Uploads' and Google+ 'Instant Uploads' - out of those one is clearly superior as it</p>
<ol class="loweralpha simple">
<li>uploads on multiple phones to the same account</li>
<li>uploads videos and images originals (including exif tags)</li>
<li>synchronizes (= download) to a headless linux machine for backups</li>
<li>works on iOS and Android</li>
<li>works in the background</li>
</ol>
<p>And the winner is: <a class="reference external" href="https://db.tt/F3Guurbv">Dropbox</a>!</p>
<p>The downside of not using the Google+ app is that it has to upload the same photo again (in limited resolution).  But practically I don't think we share more than 10% of the photos we make.  The other downside of G+ though is that at least on iOS it resizes photos.  Also there is no easy way to download the images and you cannot use a different account (unless you also want to share the G+ stream).</p>
<p>Apple Photostream is a very confined eco-system, downloading requires a Windows VM with the iCloud control panel program (yeah, been there done that).  For N iCloud users you need N user accounts which need to be configured etc.  And then it still stopped working randomly.  And it doesn't support videos.</p>

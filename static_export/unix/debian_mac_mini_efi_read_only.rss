  <title>Debian on Mac Mini (late 2011 model)</title>

  <description><![CDATA[

I just had a random hard drive corruption on my headless Mac Mini running Debian Wheezy.
Restarting it dropped to a prompt.  So I had to get out the monitor and keyboard to press 'Y' a few times.

This made me do 2 things I had postponed for a while for the risk of bricking the system:
<ol>
<li>Getting rid of rEFIt and instead use grub in native EFI mode.
<p><a href="http://glandium.org/blog/?p=2830">This guide</a> was very helpful.  Only I used the
existing fat32 partition on the drive.  This also allowed me to delete the existing MacOS
partition, very helpful on a 120G ssd.  The free'd 50G of disk space I subsequently used to...</p>
</li>
<li>Make the root partition readonly<p>
I used the now empty 50G, mkfs.ext4 as ext4 (disk alignment should start at a multiple of 64M) and
hooked it up as /var.  With /home already on a different disk I could use the <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/ReadonlyRoot">ReadonlyRoot</a> article
on the Debian wiki to mount my root filesystem readonly.  Hopefully this will prevent any future corruption preventing the system from booting.
</li>
</ol>

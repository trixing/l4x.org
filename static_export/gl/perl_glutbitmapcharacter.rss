  <title>How to use glutBitmapCharacter in Perl</title>
  <link>https://l4x.org/gl/perl_glutbitmapcharacter.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[

<p>glutBitmapCharacter is an OpenGL function used to 
   display a single character. The C function signature looks
   like this:
   <pre>void glutBitmapCharacter(void *font, int character);</pre>
   Seeing this, it should be clear that you have to call it from perl with a 
   <em>numeric</em> character value:
   <pre>glutBitmapCharacter(GLUT_BITMAP_TIMES_ROMAN_24,ord('J'));</pre>
   The trick is to use <em>ord</em> to convert the character to the character
   code. Don't try without or you'll just the the background color and no
   error message, I just lost nearly an hour over this simple thing, which is
   not so obvious if you just look at C examples. But 'J' are two very
   different things in Perl and C.

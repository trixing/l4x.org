# An update to this blog.

After roughly 2 years I found some time again to touch this blog.
I have to move hosting providers and thus I'm migrating everything
to Docker containers.  While working on that I noticed that half
of this blog isn't working, upgraded
to Pyblosxom 1.5.3 (deprecated), and hopefully fixed most of the
broken stuff.  Maybe I even get to write more.  In the meantime
at least the obvious stuff is fixed and working.  Enjoy!

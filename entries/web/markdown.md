# A new blog entry in Markdown format

I took the markdown plugin from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/seanh/PyBlosxom-Python-Markdown-2-Plugin/master/markdown-plugin.py) and fixed a few issues, most notably making it an entry parser, losely based on the `rst.py`
plugin.

This is awesome, because now I can use github to actually write blog
entries in the browser - maybe, just maybe making the hurdle a bit less to
write a few posts.

The resulting code can be found in my new [github](http://todo...) repository.

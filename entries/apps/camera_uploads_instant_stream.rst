Instant Camera Upload Apps on iOS and Android

Apple 'Photostream', Dropbox 'Camera Uploads' and Google+ 'Instant Uploads' - out of those one is clearly superior as it

a. uploads on multiple phones to the same account
b. uploads videos and images originals (including exif tags)
c. synchronizes (= download) to a headless linux machine for backups
d. works on iOS and Android
e. works in the background

And the winner is: `Dropbox <https://db.tt/F3Guurbv>`_!

The downside of not using the Google+ app is that it has to upload the same photo again (in limited resolution).  But practically I don't think we share more than 10% of the photos we make.  The other downside of G+ though is that at least on iOS it resizes photos.  Also there is no easy way to download the images and you cannot use a different account (unless you also want to share the G+ stream).

Apple Photostream is a very confined eco-system, downloading requires a Windows VM with the iCloud control panel program (yeah, been there done that).  For N iCloud users you need N user accounts which need to be configured etc.  And then it still stopped working randomly.  And it doesn't support videos.

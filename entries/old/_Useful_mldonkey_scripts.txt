Useful_mldonkey_scripts

To manage my mldonkey client under Linux I've written two scripts:<br /> 
The first one ('donkeyrotate.sh') changes mldonkey port numbers and adjusts the iptables rules accordingly. Afterwards mldonkey is restarted.<br />
The second one ('rss2donkey.pl') reads an rss feed and submits new links, which match a set of regular expressions, to mldonkey. Quite useful if run from cron.<br />
There is also a helper script 'mlcmd' which executes its parameters via netcat on mldonkey console and a init script 'donkey'.<br />
If anyone is interested in these, you can fetch them <a href="http://l4x.org/mld_utils-0.001.tar.bz2">here</a>.

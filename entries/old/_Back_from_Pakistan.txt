Back_from_Pakistan


So I've been on a fascinating trip to Pakistan for 10 days together with 7 friends (Antje, Christian, Daniel, Guenter, Isi, Kristina, Max) to witness the wedding of our common friend Sascha with his bride Zainab.<br />Here are the first pictures: http://l4x.org/site/image/tid/32.<br />Short summary (to be extended):<br />Wed, 14.4.: Hamburg to Frankfurt with railway, left Hamburg at aroung 15:00h, arrived in Frankfurt at 19:30h, then check-in for Emirates flight to Lahore via Dubai, countless security and passport checks. Started at 22:20h.<br />Thu, 15.4.: Arrived in Dubai at 6:40h (local time). We stayed for 15 hours in Hotel and have seen a bit of the city, but without car it's hard to get around. Started again at 22:00h, direction Lahore.

Cross_compilers_(Debian)

Thanks to the help of Herbert Poetzl, I've now complete buildable cross compiler toolchains (binutils and gcc) for these targets:
<code>
alpha arm cris frv h8300 hppa hppa64 i386 ia64 m32r m68k
mips mipsel mips64 ppc ppc64 s390 s390x sh shbe sh64 sh64be
sparc sparc64 v850 x86_64
</code>
and these tool versions:
<code>
binutils-2.15.94.0.2.2
binutils-2.16.90.0.3 (*)
gcc-3.3.6
gcc-3.4.4-20050512
gcc-4.0.0
</code>

These are ...

<!--break-->intendended for doing cross compiles of the linux kernel only. glibc is not provided by them. If you search real cross compile packages for Debian, you should look here: http://debian.speedblue.org.<br>
I've made a Debian repository availabe with the sources. Just add
<pre>
# binutils-cross-cc (2.15)
# gcc-newlib-cc-3.3, gcc-newlib-cc-3.4, gcc-newlib-cc-4.0
deb-src http://l4x.org/deb/ ./
# binutils-cross-cc (2.16)
deb-src http://l4x.org/deb-exp/ ./
</pre>
to your sources.list. Non Debian users can get the source by pointing the browser to http://l4x.org/deb/ and downloading the orig.tar.gz and diff.gz files respectivly. The diff.gz contains all patches which were applied to the original tree.<br>
Due to bandwidth contraints on my side, you'll have to build the
toolchain yourself, but thanks to the Debian package management system
that's quite easy (I build them on sarge, ie. gcc 3.3.5 host compiler).<br>
As a normal user switch to a new directory of your choice and do (after adding the entry to sources.list):
<pre>
apt-get source binutils-cc-cross
apt-get source gcc-newlib-cc-3.3
apt-get source gcc-newlib-cc-3.4
apt-get source gcc-newlib-cc-4.0
cd binutils-cc-cross*
fakeroot debian/rules binary
# wait about 1-2 hours
cd ../gcc-newlib-cc-3.3*
fakeroot debian/rules binary
# wait about 1-2 hours

# optional for 3.4, 4.0
cd ../gcc-newlib-cc-3.4*
fakeroot debian/rules binary
# wait about 1-2 hours
cd ../gcc-newlib-cc-4.0*
fakeroot debian/rules binary
# wait about 1-2 hours

cd ..
dpkg -i *.deb
</pre>
And you'll have all cross-compilers installed under /usr/cc/&lt;arch&gt; .
I deliberately didn't choose the normal location /usr/&lt;arch&gt; to not
get confused with real toolchains, which include libc, etc.
That's easy to change though, just by editing debian/rules prior to
compiling.<br>
You should install gcc 3.3.6 before the other gcc, as those don't provide &lt;arch&gt;-linux-gccbug, &lt;arch&gt;-linux-gcov, &lt;arch&gt;-linux-cpp symlinks in /usr/cc/&lt;arch&gt;/bin/
For convenience, the gcc-3.4 and gcc-4.0 packages install symlinks
to /usr/cc/&lt;version&gt;, so that you can switch around different
compiler versions by putting /usr/cc/&lt;version&gt; in front of your PATH.<br>
The resulting directory tree will look like this (example for arm):
<pre>
/usr/cc/3.4.4/arm-linux-gcc
/usr/cc/3.4.4/arm-linux-gccbug
/usr/cc/3.4.4/arm-linux-cpp
/usr/cc/3.4.4/arm-linux-gcov
/usr/cc/arm/bin
/usr/cc/arm/bin/arm-linux-gccbug-3.4.4
/usr/cc/arm/bin/arm-linux-gccbug
/usr/cc/arm/bin/arm-linux-gcc
/usr/cc/arm/bin/arm-linux-gcc-3.3.6
/usr/cc/arm/bin/arm-linux-cpp
/usr/cc/arm/bin/arm-linux-gcov
/usr/cc/arm/bin/arm-linux-gcc-3.4.4
/usr/cc/arm/bin/arm-linux-gcov-3.4.4
/usr/cc/arm/bin/arm-linux-cpp-3.4.4
/usr/cc/arm/bin/arm-linux-addr2line
/usr/cc/arm/bin/arm-linux-c++filt
/usr/cc/arm/bin/arm-linux-size
/usr/cc/arm/bin/arm-linux-readelf
/usr/cc/arm/bin/arm-linux-nm
/usr/cc/arm/bin/arm-linux-ar
/usr/cc/arm/bin/arm-linux-strings
/usr/cc/arm/bin/arm-linux-as
/usr/cc/arm/bin/arm-linux-objcopy
/usr/cc/arm/bin/arm-linux-ranlib
/usr/cc/arm/bin/arm-linux-ld
/usr/cc/arm/bin/arm-linux-strip
/usr/cc/arm/bin/arm-linux-objdump
</pre>
ps: These packages are kind of a hack. The control file, for example, is generated on the fly. Please bear with we.<br>

(*) The 2.16 binutils are pretty pedantic about assembler code. Therefore they are in a seperate repository under http://l4x.org/deb-exp/.[[!meta date="2008-11-25 21:13:27"]]

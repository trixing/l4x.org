	3&nbsp;μm thick titanium layer was used as plating base as well as
	etch time-controlled sacrificial layer for the release of the cantilever
	beam. The parallel plate layout includes narrow gaps and cantilever
	beams with an aspect ratio in nickel of up to 60 for 1&nbsp;mm long
	features. Auxiliary structures support the beams and gaps during
	the processing. Room temperature electroplating significantly reduces
	the risk of deformations compared to the standard process temperature
	of 52C. The capacitors operate in the 1–5&nbsp;GHz range, and demonstrate
	good {RF} performance, with quality factors on the order of 170 at

  number = {1},
  abstract = {This paper reports the development of an absolute wireless pressure
	sensor that consists of a capacitive sensor and a gold-electroplated
	planar coil. Applied pressure deflects a 6�[mu]m-thin silicon diaphragm,
	changing the capacitance formed between it and a metal electrode
	supported on a glass substrate. The resonant frequency of the LC
	circuit formed by the capacitor and the inductor changes as the capacitance
	changes; this change is sensed remotely through inductive coupling,
	eliminating the need for wire connection or implanted telemetry circuits.
	The sensor is fabricated using the dissolved-wafer process and utilizes
	a boron-doped silicon diaphragm supported on an insulating glass
	substrate. The complete sensor measures 2.6 mm�1.6�mm in size and
	incorporates a 24-turns gold-electroplated coil that has a measured
	inductance of 1.2�[mu]H. The sensor is designed to provide a resonant
	frequency change in the range 95--103�MHz for a pressure change in
	the range 0--50�mmHg with respect to ambient pressure, providing a
	pressure responsivity and sensitivity of 160�kHz/mmHg and 1553�ppm/mmHg,
	respectively. The measured pressure responsivity and sensitivity
	of the fabricated device are 120�kHz/mmHg and 1579�ppm/mmHg, respectively.},

	the detection of vibration modes and of their resonance curves, the

  abstract = {This report deals with a comparison of national standards of rf voltage
	organized by the radiofrequency working group of the "Comite Consultatif
	d'Electricite" of the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM).
	It was done by sending round transfer standards, for each of which
	the participating laboratories had to measure the rf-dc difference
	for a reading of 1 V at frequencies from 100 MHz to 1 GHz. The seven
	standardizing laboratories participating in this comparison were:
	ASMW (GDR), EQD (UK), NBS (USA), NML (Australia), OMH (Hungary),
	PTB (FRG) and VNIIM (USSR). The Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt
	(PTB) acted as pilot laboratory. Two kinds of transfer standards
	were circulated in two separate cycles: two resistance mounts (50
	O and 75 O input impedance) and two thermal converters made available
	by the PTB and the OMH. The results are presented in two tables and
	16 bar charts. A weighted mean value for each transfer standard and
	frequency was calculated from the measurement results. Good agreement
	between the measurement values of all participants was achieved.
	For resistance-mount transfer standards the deviations of the measured
	values from the weighted mean values were [?] 4 x 10--3 for all frequencies
	up to 1 GHz, for thermal converters all deviations were [?] 3 x 10--3
	at 100 MHz and [?] 1.2 x 10--2 at 1 GHz (excluding one measurement
	point). All the transfer standards remained sufficiently stable over
	a measuring period of more than 5 years.},

  abstract = {Surface micromachined metal armatures are commonly used for {MEMS}
	applications of which RF-MEMS is the most well known. In most cases
	metals with a high conductivity, such as aluminum or gold, are used.
	These metals often have a low melting point and therefore have a
	low thermal stability and show plastic deformation of the structures
	at relatively low temperatures ($<$200 degC). High melting point
	metals, such as platinum, are expected to show plastic deformation
	only at higher temperatures which makes them interesting for use
	as a structural layer in RF-MEMS devices. In this paper, we present
	a technology to realize suspended platinum structures by means of
	surface micromachining. An improved lift-off process allows patterning
	1 um Pt films on a polyimide sacrificial layer. A comparison of the
	characteristics and armature resonance frequencies between RF-MEMS
	switches with Pt armatures and AlCu0.5\% alloy armatures reveals
	an increased thermal stability for the former up to at least 250
	degC. This enables zero-level packaging of switches at relative high
	temperatures without affecting their performances. The lower conductivity
	of Pt compared to AlCu0.5\% does not lead to a significant increase

	on sensing the electrostatic force between an {RF} signal line and
	a suspended membrane. The electrostatic force, which is proportional
	to the square of the rms signal voltage and thus to the signal power,
	results in a displacement of the suspended membrane. This displacement
	is detected capacitively, allowing the sensing of the signal power
	with extremely low dissipative losses; therefore the sensor can be
	placed in a transmission line with negligible disturbance of the
	signal. Devices have been designed and fabricated successfully by
	aluminum surface micromachining using photoresist as the sacrificial
	layer. Optimization of the design with SONNET has resulted in measured
	return and insertion losses (S11 and S21) better than [?]30 dB and

	for a very high aspect ratio {MEMS} optical scanning mirror (5 mm
	x 150 um clear aperture), capable of a +-2deg sweep at 1 kHz with
	an applied voltage less than 200 V. This paper reports on the design,
	fabrication, modeling and testing of such an electrostatically actuated
	MEMS mirror. Fabrication involves using a [?]1 0 0[?] n-type double
	side polished silicon wafer, along with surface and bulk micromachining
	techniques, to produce a mirror with nickel torsion springs and nickel
	electrostatic actuators. There were 8 masks and 20 processing steps
	required. The performance of these devices was measured and found
	to be within the required specifications. Analysis involved developing
	models to predict the dynamic behavior of these {MEMS} micromirrors.
	A basic parallel plate capacitor model was adjusted with finite element
	analysis to account for fringing fields. Young's modulus of the electroplated
	nickel was determined to be 110 GPa from a comparison of the model
	with the results of dynamic testing, and the residual strain test
	structures led to a value of 0.0029 for the residual strain. Each
	of these values is within the rather wide range of published values.
	Once these values were determined, the model agreed very well with
	the measurements of the dynamic angular response of the mirror.},

  abstract = {In this paper we present a silicon wafer bonding technique for 3D
	microstructures using {MEMS} process technology. Photo-definable
	material with patternable characteristics served as the bonding layer
	between the silicon wafers. A bonding process was developed and several
	types of photo-definable material were tested for bonding strength
	and pattern spatial resolution. The results indicated that SU-8 is
	the best material with a bonding strength of up to 213 kg cm$^{\&minus;2}$
	(20.6 MPa), and a spatial resolution of 10 \&mu;m, at a layer thickness
	of up to 100 \&mu;m. The low-temperature bonding technique that is
	presented is particularly suitable for microstructure and microelectronics
	integration involved in {MEMS} packaging. },

	millimeter-wave telecommunication systems are proposed. Two types
	of millimeter-wave tunable filters have been fabricated using micromachining
	technology and the responses of the filters have been measured: one
	type is a two-pole lumped element filter and the other a two-pole
	resonator filter. The frequency tunability of the filter has been
	achieved by changing the gap between a common coplanar waveguide
	ground plate and a movable cantilever beam connected to the transmission
	line with a controllable range of 2.5 um. The deflection of the cantilever
	beam has been measured with applied dc voltage. With the applied
	bias voltage from 0 to 50 V, the fabricated filters have shown center
	frequency shifts of 0.6 GHz (2.3\%) at 26.6 GHz and 0.8 GHz (2.5\%)
	at 32 GHz for the lumped element and resonator filters, respectively.
	The mechanical lifetime of the fabricated gold cantilever structure
	has been tested by observing the existence of the spring memory phenomenon;
	there is no memory phenomenon or breakdown until a repeated actuation
	of 1.6x108 cycles.},

	(pull-in) is discussed on the basis of the energy minimum principle.
	An expression for the pull-in voltage of a beam is given. The electromechanical
	behaviour in a limited frequency regime around the fundamental resonance
	is accurately modelled by an electric circuit consisting of a (static)
	capacitor shunted by a series (dynamic) RLC branch. The d.c. bias
	dependence of the circuit components and of the series resonance
	frequency has been experimentally investigated and is compared with
	the theory. The large-amplitude behaviour is discussed as well. The
	plate modulus and residual strain of boron-doped polysilicon are
	estimated from the resonance frequencies of microbridges of varying
	lengths. The feasibility of their application as resonant strain
	gauges is investigated. The 210 m long beams typically have an unloaded
	fundamental frequency of 324 kHz, a gauge factor of 2400 and an uncompensated

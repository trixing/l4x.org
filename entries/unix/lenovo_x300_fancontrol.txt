Controlling the fan speed of a Lenovo X300 under Linux

The Lenovo X300 has a really annoying fan running with high speeds already at low (40C) CPU temperatures. The lm-sensors package comes with a fancontrol daemon which does user space fan regulation. Just put this in your /etc/fancontrol

<pre>
INTERVAL=10
FCTEMPS=hwmon0/device/pwm1=hwmon0/device/temp1_input
FCFANS= hwmon0/device/pwm1=hwmon0/device/fan1_input
MINTEMP=hwmon0/device/pwm1=60
MAXTEMP=hwmon0/device/pwm1=70
MINSTART=hwmon0/device/pwm1=32
MINSTOP=hwmon0/device/pwm1=32
MINPWM=hwmon0/device/pwm1=32
MAXPWM=hwmon0/device/pwm1=128
</pre>

This will give you 1800 rpm for CPU temperatures > 50C and 5500 rpm (the next level) for temperatures higher 70C. As the fan is barely noticeable at 1800 and 70C is only reached by running two processes with 100% CPU load for more then 5 minutes (even at 30C ambient temperature) this will give you a nearly totally silent laptop :-). A pwm value of 255 sounds like a jet starting (8000 rpm)...

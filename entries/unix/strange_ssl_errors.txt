Strange SSL Errors happening...

If you ever encounter Firefox saying
<pre>Error code: ssl_error_rx_record_too_long</pre>
or Chrome / Chromium / Webkit complaining with
<pre>Error 107 (net::ERR_SSL_PROTOCOL_ERROR): SSL protocol error.</pre>
and you just reconfigured your Apache webserver, adding a new
VirtualHost on port 443, make sure you didn't forget
<pre>SSLEnable on</pre>
in the VirtualHost block.
Otherwise Apache tries to serve non-encrypted content over the SSL-port and web browsers don't
like that and don't produce helpful error messages. Nothing in the
Apache log files either...

How to fix "A disk read error occurred" when using a Windows XP image in Virtualbox

If you encounter the error "A disk read error occured" when trying<br />to boot Windows XP off a raw disk image using Virtualbox (either directly by using<br />the write-through support or indirectly by booting a 1:1 copy) most<br />probably the BIOS of the original system reported an odd drive geometry<br />(C/H/S - Cylinders/Heads/Sectors).<br /><br />To fix this boot the _physical_ system,<br />go to the grub command line, type 'c' to invoke the command prompt and then execute the command 'geometry (hd0)'. Write down the cylinders, heads and<br />sectors values reported. Back in your host system, open the .vmdk file using a normal text editor, scroll down to the end of the file and adjust the following lines<br /><pre><br />ddb.geometry.biosCylinders="1023"<br />ddb.geometry.biosHeads="240"<br />ddb.geometry.biosSectors="63"<br /></pre>.<br />(1023/240/63 are the values reported by the Lenovo X300 Notebook BIOS).<br /><br />Now try to boot Windows in the virtualized environment. In my case it<br />worked right on the first try. There may also be a Windows tool to get<br />the original drive geometry.<br /><br />The short explanation is, that the boot loader from Windows seems to have<br />hard coded values for the drive geometry

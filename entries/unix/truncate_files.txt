How to truncate a file the UNIX way

Astonishingly a search for 'truncate unix utility' doesn't turn up anything useful<br />apart from hundreds of references to the ftruncate man page.<br />This is how I did it:<br /><pre><br />dd of=destfile bs=1 seek=newsize count=1 &lt;/dev/null<br /></pre><br />where newsize can be 1k, 400G, whatever and destfile is obviously the<br />destination filename.
